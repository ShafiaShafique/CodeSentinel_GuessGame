# CodeSentinel_GuessGame
This is a simple Java-based "Guess the Number" game. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user must guess it. After each attempt, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high or too low. The total number of attempts is displayed once the correct number is guessed.
